            <h2>'The worst thing I've ever done': Dog is visited by evil scanner on Halloween -- then 'cries for a whole day'</h2>
            <p>
                <b>What happened to Fairley the labrador?</b>
                <br>
                Santa Ana detectives are trying to find out what might have driven a dog to savagely attack a police scanner during a Halloween party.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                The surveillance video captured the moment when the tense event turned to chaos. As the Santa Ana Police Department watched it, officers were <i>"forever horrified,"</i> Capt. Jim England said.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                <i>"There was a handler just standing there with a service dog that he was filming on camera and he turned around and did what he did and the dog stabbed the canine. It was just incredible to see," </i> England said.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                The clip starts with the pup quietly patrolling the yard at about 3 a.m. when police arrived to investigate a report of a drunk person in the park. Investigators wearing helmets and body cameras peek out the back door to keep an eye on the dog while a patrol officer keeps watch in front of the house.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                With the help of an infrared sensor, the officer sets up a basic police scanner and tries to signal the dog. The handler, identified as Eric Ortiz, does not stop recording, but apparently the outcome was not what he had hoped for.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                The video captures a horrifying moment. Fairley the labrador is seen slamming open the doors to a home and clambering up to the patio. The handlers would later tell detectives that the dog lunged at one of the officers's batons, England said.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                As the chaos continues, Fairley charges off the patio and runs through the yard, bashing past and past other officers. The attack, which lasted about two minutes, seemingly goes unchecked by anyone until one of the handlers walks by. He looks down at Fairley and screams.
                <br class="paragraph-break">
                Orange County Animal Care and the Santa Ana Police Department are investigating the incident. Anyone with information about the incident is asked <b>to call Orange County Animal Care at 714-971-6800 or Santa Ana Police Department at 714-245-7800</b>.
